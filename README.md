#GroupMe-Events-Bot

I wanted to make a better way for my residents to know what is happening around campus. Thus this bot was born. Currently the bot responds to the following commands:


command: !events, !events this week 

groupme_bot_response: the events for the current week with date, title, location, and time

command: !maintenance 

groupme_bot_response: check if the maintenance office is open at the current time. Send the phone number for regular hours. If weekend or after 5pm send after-hours emergency number.
